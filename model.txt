Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
Step 1: Set Up Your Local Development Environment

    Install XAMPP, MAMP, or LAMP for local PHP and MySQL/MariaDB.

    Create a new project folder as shown above.

Step 2: Build the Database

    In database/, design your ER schema (tables: users, attendance, sessions, justifications, courses...).

    Create a .sql file (e.g. attendance_db.sql) for initial setup.

    Use phpMyAdmin to import and initialize the database.

    ​

Step 3: Create Modular Backend Files

    In includes/, add:

        db_connect.php: centralized DB connection logic.

        auth.php: user authentication and role check helpers.

        functions.php: reusable PHP logic (data validation, error logging).

Step 4: Design Core Pages for Each Role

    Student pages (student/):

        dashboard.php (list courses, view attendance).

        justify.php (submit absence justifications).

    Professor pages (professor/):

        dashboard.php (courses + sessions).

        mark_attendance.php (take attendance).

        summary.php (attendance table).

    Admin pages (admin/):

        dashboard.php (stats/charts).

        manage_students.php (CRUD, import/export).

        settings.php (other configs).

Step 5: Implement Frontend with jQuery

    In assets/js/, include jQuery and add logic for AJAX form submissions and UI interactivity.

    Use assets/css/ for responsive/mobile-first styles (Bootstrap or custom).

Step 6: Add Reusable Templates

    Put header, footer, navigation bars, and common forms in templates/.

    Include these into pages using PHP include.

Step 7: Develop Authentication & Role Management

    On index.php, process login and route users to the right dashboard based on role.

    Block access to unauthorized pages using logic from auth.php.

Step 8: Connect Frontend to Backend

    Use jQuery AJAX to submit forms without full page reloads (e.g., attendance marking, justification upload).

    Return JSON or HTML as appropriate.

Step 9: Test and Debug

    Test each user flow: login, attendance marking, stats, import/export.

    Make sure error handling and feedback are clear.

    Fix bugs and optimize queries.

Step 10: Final Review & Documentation

    Clean up code and organize files.

    Provide instructions in README.md for setup, usage, and demo accounts.

Quick Visual Reminder

    Structure & Flow Mnemonic:
    MVC — Model (Database), View (Templates/Assets), Controller (Backend PHP for each role)

Next step for you:
Which feature or user role would you like to start with? If you tell me your exact course or grade level, I can make this plan even more tailored. And if you want example code for one page or folder, let me know what you'd like to see!
